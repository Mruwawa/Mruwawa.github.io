                    After each hour of working with a computer, we should change to an activity that does not burden our eyesight or one that requires a different body position. It's best to use this time to look out the window and do some simple stretching exercises. These few moments will let your eyes and body tired from sitting rest and gain energy for further work.

                        The workplace should be arranged in such a way that all devices we use for work are at hand. If we have to extend our hand far, we will begin to experience negative consequences very quickly. The distance between the edge of the desk and the keyboard placed on it should be greater than 10 cm, so you can put your hand on the desk.

                        The height of the desk should allow you to sit in a relaxed position, with a right angle between your shoulder and forearm, with an appropriate viewing angle of the monitor screen in the range of 20-50 Â°. The top edge of the screen should not be above the user's eyes. The height of the desk should also ensure not touching the tabletop with your knees.

                        It is also important how we place the monitor on the desk, more specifically how far we sit from it. According to health and safety regulations describing safe work with a computer, the distance between the user and the monitor should be between 40 cm to 75 cm. Additionally, the monitor should be positioned so that the light source, i.e. the window or the lamp, is not behind it. Ideally, the light should be to the side of the screen.

                    The chair is no less important than the desk. Only the right combination of these two things will allow you to create an ergonomic workplace. Adjustable height of the seat and backrest is only part of the properties of a good chair, because it should also be stable, have armrests, a minimum 5-support base and wheels, and allow it to rotate around its axis. Its size should guarantee comfortable sitting and free body posture. Additionally, the seat and backrest should be profiled according to the natural curve of the spine. An important addition to the armchair may turn out to be a footrest, which will prove useful if the user is unable to easily put their feet on the floor while sitting on the chair.

                    The last thing is corrective glasses, adapted to computer safety, for those with a visual impairment. <br> If we do not have a vision defect. there are special computer glasses with blue light filters available on the market, which could be worth looking into.
